Code Example
 - Step 0 -  Starting off with Ember starter kit with tweaks
  - Twitter.css
  - showdown.js
  - moment.js

 - Step 1 - Create an App
  - App = Ember.Application.create()
   - Namespace
   - Event Listener
   - Router -> routing
  - Refresh the page and see nothing
  - Add the application template(Snippet: step1)
   - A template, written in the Handlebars templating language, describes the user interface of your application. Each template is backed by a model, and the template automatically updates itself if the model changes.
   - Plain HTML wrapped in a script tag with a special type
  - Refresh the page and see that Ember has rendered this template to the page

 - Step 2 - The About route
  - Create a router (Snippet: router)
   - The router translates a URL into a series of nested templates, each backed by a model. As the templates or models being shown to the user change, Ember automatically keeps the URL in the browser's address bar up-to-date.
  - Create about template (Snippet: about_template)
  - Highlight convention of template id and route name
  - Refresh page and nothing happens.
  - Add #/about to url and still nothing happens
  - Add {{outlet}} to main application template
   - Outlets are placeholders for template rendering
  - Refresh the page and see the about content
  - Add {{#linkTo 'about' }} helper
  - Click the link
   - renders content
   - Updates the url
   - Adds the active class (bold)

 - Step 3 - Posts (Getting data from the server)
  - 3a - Ember data
   - Define a store (Snippet: store)
    - The store is the repository that holds loaded models, and is responsible for retrieving models that have not yet been loaded.
    - Using the FixtureAdapter store for now
   - Define a model (Snippet: post_model)
    - A model is an object that stores persistent state.
    - App.Post
   - Fixture data (Snippet: post_fixture)
  - 3b - Displaying static content
   - Define Posts resource
    - Router:  this.resource('posts');
   - Define Posts template (Snippet: posts_template)
   - Change posts link in navbar to use {{linkTo 'posts'}}
   - Refresh the page and click posts and you should see static content
  - 3c - Display the fixture data
   - Use the handlebars each helper to iterate over the posts (wrap <tr><td>)
    - {{#each model}}....{{/each}}
   - Replace Title and Author with {{title}} and {{author}}
   - Refresh the page, click Posts - nothing is displayed
    - We haven't told Ember what model to use for the template
  - 3d - Create a Route
   - A route is an object that tells the template which model it should display.
   - App.PostsRoute (Snippet: posts_route)

 - Step 4 - Display post detail
  - When clicking post link, display contents of the post on the right.
  - 4a - Create a nested route (works with the URL)
   - Add function() argument to 'posts' resource definition
   	- function() {
   		this.resource('post', { path: ':post_id' })
   	}
   	- It includes a dynamic segment
  - 4b - Define the post template
   - Snippet: post_template
   - Add linkTo helper to posts template
    - {{linkTo 'post' this}}...{{/linkTo}}
    - Refresh..hover over link and see the url...click and nothing happens. Why not?
   - Add {{outlet}} inside "span9" of posts template
    - Refresh the page
    - Click the link
    - Look at the url

 - Step 5 - Handlebar helpers
  - Fix the ugly date with moment.js
  - 5a - Create the date helper (Snippet: date_helper)
   - Add it to the template everywhere that we are using
   - Refresh that page and voila!
   - Bound helper = Update the date in dev tools
    - App.Post.find(1).set('publishedAt', new Date())
  - 5b - Format the contents of the posts as Markdown (Snippet: markdown_helper)
   - Ember templates escape html by default so we have to use SafeString
   - Add it to intro and extended
   - Refresh the page

 - Step 6 - CRUD
  - 6a - Add edit mode content to the post template
   - Snippet: post_edit_template
   - #if helper
   - action helper - triggers events (controller -> route)
  - 6b - PostController
   - A controller is an object that stores application state. A template can optionally have a controller in addition to a model, and can retrieve properties from both.
   - Named functions to handle actions
   - Notice the "set" functions - this is for binding
  - 6c - Editing UI
   - Create a partial (Snippet: posts_edit_partial)
    - View
     - Need advanced user event handling
     - Re-usable component
   - Use partial helper to include content {{partial 'post/edit'}}
   - Show that edit works

 - Step 7 - Loose ends
  - 7a - Nothing is displayed when Posts clicked
   - Posts index (Snippet: posts_index_template)
  - 7b - On app initial load, show posts
   - Explicitly create IndexRoute that redirects to posts
    - Snippet: index_route

 - Step 8 - Get the data from a server
  - Delete the fixture data
  - Change store to use DS.RESTAdapter
   - adapter: DS.RESTAdapter.extend({
      url: 'http://localhost:3000'
     })
  - Serve the app

 - Step 9 - Implement save
  - In doneEditing:
   - this.get('store').commit();

Tooling
 - Ember Chrome Plugin
  - 
 - Ember tools
  - About
   - node-based tool
   - file organization conventions
   - scaffolding (rudimentary)
   - template precompilation for performance
   - single file application build for convenience
   - generators for faster application development
   - commonjs (node-style) modules
  - Demo
   - ember create ember-tools-client
   - ember generate --scaffold person name:string age:number
   - ember build
   - open index.html
   - visit #/people
  - Pros
   - Just ember
   - Under active development
   - Simple
  - Cons
   - Just generate and build (no testing, http server, sass/compass)
   - Scaffolding sucks
   - Not designed for pluggability
 - Yeoman
  - About
   - a collection of tools and best practices working in harmony to make developing for the web even better.
   - Node
   - Yo - Scaffolds
   - Grunt - Task-based build tool
   - Bower - dependency management for the web
   - Ember Generator
  - Demo
   - mkdir yeoman-client
   - cd yeoman-client
   - yo ember
